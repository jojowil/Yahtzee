This Java version of game play was the result of work in class with my students. We started with a text based version of the game and swiftly decided a GUI would be more fun.

So, we began the GUI and completed about 93% of the button functionality by the end of the Fall 2024 semester.

This was a lot of fun and helped the students further their understanding of how to build a GUI using basic JavaFX capabilities along with a single Lambda event handler. 

Every effort has been made to keep the content simple to understand and is intended to be used with new learners. This will be integrated into the first half of the [Java Programming by Design](https://programmingby.design/javabook/) textbook.

The code is relatively well documented and will continue to receive care and feeding as it gets incorporated into the textbook.
